                    arbitration arises, you agree that any arbitration hearing shall be held in New York City, New York; you consent to the personal jurisdiction of all courts located in the State of New York for purposes of enforcing this arbitration agreement and any arbitration
                    award; and you agree that any arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in the English language. If any party unsuccessfully resists confirmation or enforcement of an arbitration award rendered under this agreement, then all costs,
                    attorneys' fees, and expenses incurred by the other party or parties in confirming or enforcing the award shall be fully assessed against and paid by the party resisting confirmation or enforcement of the award. This agreement contains
                    a predispute arbitration clause. By signing this Agreement the parties agree as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            (1) All parties to this agreement are giving up the right to sue each other in court, including the right to a trial by jury, except as provided by the rules of the arbitration forum in which a claim is filed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            (2) Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a party's ability to have a court reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            (3) The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and other discovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            (4) The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award unless, in an eligible case, a joint request for an explained decision has been submitted by all parties to the panel at least 20 days prior to the first scheduled hearing date.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            (5) The panel of arbitrators may include a minority of arbitrators who were or are affiliated with the securities industry.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
