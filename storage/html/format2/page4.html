                If you are investing under Rule 506(c) of Regulation D, your status as an “Accredited Investor” will also need to be verified and you will be asked to provide documentation supporting your income, net worth, revenue, or net assets or a letter from a qualified
                advisor (e.g. Registered Investment Advisor or Registered Broker Dealer). The Barriowealth Parties do not recommend or endorse any of the offerings on this site nor do they determine the appropriateness of any investment for a particular
                investor or class of investors.</li>
