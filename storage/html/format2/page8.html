                    Adviser does not review any action or inaction of a Fiduciary with respect to any transaction(s) therein and we are not responsible for determining whether a Fiduciary's action or inaction satisfies the standard of care applicable to such Fiduciary's
                    handling of a transaction. Adviser is not responsible for determining the validity of a person or entity's status or capacity to serve as a Fiduciary.

                <p>
                    All orders for the purchase and sale of securities are authorized by you and executed in reliance on your representation, action and promise that an actual purchase or sale is intended. You understand Adviser may at any time, in our sole discretion and

                    any transaction we are under no obligation to inform you or any other person of such declination, nor to provide any reason or substantiation for such declination, and will not be held responsible for any problems with such declination
                    including but not limited to lost opportunities, lost profits, lost participation interests, or other lost or forgone benefits that you or others might otherwise have received had the effecting of the transaction(s) not been declined
                    by us.
